          Although Sapsama has an undisputed and well reputed track record over the past 25 years, the firm´s Swedish
          subsidiary Sapsama AB experienced problems with non-paying clients in 2014/15.
          <br><br>
          Having completed fully satisfactory services in designing and construction supervising rehabilitation works at
          Goma International Airport in Eastern Congo with German Agro Action in 2014, the national aviation authority
          Régie Des Voies Aériennes, RVA, who had contracted Sapsama, failed to fulfil their contractual payment
          obligations.
          <br><br>
          The Embassy of Sweden offered to intervene, and helped organise an agreement to the effect that the parties
          should share the costs 50%. In spite of this signed agreement, RVA did not fulfil its obligations.
          <br><br>
          Coincidentally, Sapsama AB simultaneously had another two clients in Sweden who refrained from fulfilling
          their
          duties. We will provide further information on these two clients and the details regarding their decisions not
          to fulfil their contractual payment obligations once those processes have been finalised.
          <br><br>
          Although it is not uncommon to see this kind of behaviour from government agencies in certain developing
          countries, it is highly uncommon to see public agencies in the western industrialised world fail to meet its
          contractual obligations.
